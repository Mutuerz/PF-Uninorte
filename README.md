## 1. Title
Data acquisition and storage system for a LCD display.

## 2. Problem
Many companies focused on refrigeration, with machines that regulate temperature in closed environments, do not have an internal control system for their mechanisms. The current process used for data collection consists of an operator who, at certain intervals of time, records the information shown on the screens of the devices in a spreadsheet. This situation causes the company to lose money due to the poor regulation of their systems and they see the need to invest in a control model.

## 3. Justification
Due to the above, there is a need for a system capable of obtaining and analyzing this data in a simple and comfortable way for the company. The data provided by the systems are shown in a display, therefore, the proposed methodology consists in the installation of a webcam that focuses on that display. In this way it is posible to monitor the data without having the need to have hardware inside the company with the exception of the camera and a small computer system. By means of image analysis it is possible to obtain numerical and non-numerical values, and finally send them to a web server where the correlation and analysis of data will be performed.

## 4. Objectives
  * ### General
      1.  Design and implement a platform that allows the acquisition and correlation of data for a York brand, model 2012, cooling system.
  * ### Specifics
      1.  Design and implement a system for data monitoring through a webcam.
      2.  Design and implement a system that extracts the variables through image processing.
      3.  Implement a system for sending variables to a server through the Internet.
      4.  Design and implement a system for variables' correlation.
      5.  Design and implement a system correlations' visualization.
